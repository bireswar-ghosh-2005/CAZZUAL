    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") govern your use of the
      services provided by <b>Cazzual</b> ("we", "us", "our"). By accessing,
      submitting a project request, making a payment, or using any services
      offered by Cazzual, you agree to be bound by these Terms in full. If you do
      not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Services</h2>
    <p>
      Cazzual provides project development, software solutions, academic project
      assistance, design services, and related digital deliverables. All services
      are provided on a best-effort basis and are subject to availability,
      feasibility, technical constraints, and internal review.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Project Submission and Review</h2>
    <p>
      Submission of a project request does not guarantee acceptance. Every
      project request submitted through our website or any communication channel
      is subject to internal review by our team members. The decision to accept
      or reject a project rests solely and exclusively with the members of
      Cazzual. This decision is final and binding, and no justification is
      required to be provided for rejection.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Acceptance and Rejection Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Projects may be accepted or rejected based on factors including but not
      limited to technical feasibility, timelines, workload, ethical concerns,
      resource availability, and internal discretion. Cazzual reserves the right
      to reject any project without prior notice or explanation.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Payments and No Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      All payments made to Cazzual are strictly non-refundable under any
      circumstances. Once a payment is completed, the client acknowledges and
      agrees that no refund, chargeback, or reversal will be entertained,
      regardless of project status, dissatisfaction, delays, or cancellation
      from the client's side.
    </p>

    <p>
      By making a payment, the client confirms full understanding and acceptance
      of the no-refund policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Pricing and Add-ons</h2>
    <p>
      Pricing for projects is determined after acceptance and may vary depending
      on scope, complexity, timeline, and additional requirements. Any add-ons,
      modifications, or extra features requested after project acceptance will
      be communicated separately. Add-ons will be provided within <b>18 hours</b>
      after the acceptance email has been sent from our side, unless otherwise
      stated explicitly.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Delivery Timelines</h2>
    <p>
      Delivery timelines are estimates and not guarantees. While we strive to
      meet agreed timelines, Cazzual shall not be held liable for delays caused
      by technical issues, external dependencies, force majeure events, or
      changes requested by the client.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Official communication will be conducted through email or other channels
      specified by Cazzual. Clients are responsible for providing accurate and
      accessible contact details. Cazzual is not responsible for missed
      communications due to incorrect email addresses or inactive accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Postal and Courier Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      In cases where physical materials, documents, or deliverables are sent via
      postal services or courier partners, Cazzual bears no responsibility for
      delays, loss, damage, theft, or misplacement once the item has been handed
      over to the postal or courier service. Responsibility thereafter lies
      solely with the carrier.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all intellectual property created by
      Cazzual remains the property of Cazzual until full payment is received.
      Unauthorized redistribution, resale, or public sharing of deliverables
      without permission is strictly prohibited.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Under no circumstances shall Cazzual or its members be liable for any
      indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from the
      use or inability to use our services. This includes but is not limited to
      academic penalties, business losses, missed opportunities, or reputational
      damage.
    </p>

    <h2>11. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Clients are responsible for ensuring that their project requirements do
      not violate any laws, institutional rules, academic integrity policies, or
      third-party rights. Cazzual is not responsible for misuse of delivered
      work.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Amendments</h2>
    <p>
      Cazzual reserves the right to modify, update, or change these Terms and
      Conditions at any time without prior notice. Continued use of our services
      after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws
      applicable in the jurisdiction in which Cazzual operates.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Final Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>
      By using this website and submitting a project request, you acknowledge
      that you have read, understood, and agreed to all the Terms and Conditions
      stated above in their entirety.
